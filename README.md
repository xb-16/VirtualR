Over the past two months, I've been studying [**React**](https://react.dev/learn) and [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) extensively, primarily through their official documentation and various other resources. Now, it's time to put that knowledge into practice by building something real!  

I followed a tutorial by **@kushald** on YouTube:

During the project, I used:  
- **[Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react)** for the icons.  
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design, leveraging its utility classes to make the page fully responsive.  

This was a great learning experience, and I feel my skills have improved significantly. Special thanks to **@kushald** for the excellent tutorial!
